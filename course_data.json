  "course_name": "Learn Kubernetes: A Deep Dive - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Kubernetes helps deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure so it doesn’t matter if you're deploying your applications to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or your own on-premises datacenter. Ready to get started?\n\nIn this course, you will cover the most essential Kubernetes concepts that you’ll need to know to be proficient, including pods, services, and deployments. Beyond that though, you will learn about the Kubernetes architecture, how to build clusters, and how to deploy and manage applications. \n\nIn the last part of the course, you will dive into threat modeling and real-world security practices. By the end of this course, you will have a great new skill for your resume and you’ll be able to start using Kubernetes in your own projects.",
